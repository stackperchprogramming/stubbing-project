STUBBING PROJECT

The Stub file is StubTesting.cpp. User.h is just a generic user class containg an error message and a bunch of empty functions. StubbingDocument.pdf shows the output. This menu could be easily altered to update users in an organization's database. I tried to keep it simple. The temptation to "take it to the next level" is ovewhelming :).
